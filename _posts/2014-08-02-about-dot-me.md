## About

If you've not already used the service let me tell me about <http://about.me> which is precisely a cool service available. Most of us usually have joined more than one 
network, be it job portals, social networks or just websites and if you've to tell someone about all of them it could be a tedious task to do. So, here comes the <http://about.me>, it lets you add all of your account under one page, add all your 
social links/websites, contact details and bio. If you want  you can list all your skills and get exposure, and good if you're looking for a job. You get a personal URL i.e. *http://about.me/myname*. About.me collects all the feeds from your social profiles and can display it 
on your about me page, if you've updated a status on Facebook people can see it right there on your page, have a blog ? no problem, it will display your posts on your very personal page.

## Interface

Signing up for the service is quite easy, you can sign-up using your social network or if you prefer using email address instead, you can go for that. After signing up and confirming email
you'll get access to your account where you can add all the information about you, like name , description and anything else you like, by default you're provided with some beautiful images
to set as background but if you prefer using your own, you can upload and use it as background. The box containing all your information is movable so, place it where ever you like on the display.
