##About 

*WordPress* is a free and open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL, which requires web hosting service. Features include a plug-in architecture and a template system. 
WordPress is a software script that you can install on your server. To do this you need a web host who meets the minimum requirements and a little time. WordPress is completely customizable and can be used for almost anything. WordPress started as just a blogging system, but has evolved to be used as full content management system and so much more through the thousands of plugins and widgets and themes.
Prior to WordPress 3.0, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multi-User (WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. That means on a single installation you can enable your own blogging network or you can use this single installation for your eCommerce website and for your blog also for your business. 
WordPress MU adds eight new data tables for each blog.

##Popularity

##Features


- One very popular feature of WordPress is its plugin architecture which allows users and developers to extend its abilities beyond the core installation. 
- WordPress has a database of over 26,000 plugins, each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs. These customizations range from Search Engine Optimization enhancers to content displaying features, such as the addition of widgets and navigation bars.

##More

There is also a service called WordPress.com (supported by ads) which lets you get started with a new and free WordPress-based blog in seconds, but varies in several ways and is less flexible than the WordPress you download and install yourself. If your main aim is just to write then WordPress.com is great tool for you but if you're planning for something big with more possibilities then you should go for WordPress.org(full control) and install it on your WebHostingService/Server .
